# 🏥 Representing Data: Hospital Insights with PostgreSQL & Power BI

### By: Dimple Sharma

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing hospital data using **PostgreSQL** for backend processing and **Power BI** for front-end visualization. It aims to derive meaningful insights into:

- Patient demographics  
- Hospital operations  
- Financial performance  
- Doctor efficiency  
- Seasonal health trends  

With a structured approach, the dataset was cleaned, queried, and visualized to help hospital administrators make data-driven decisions.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **pgAdmin 4** – For PostgreSQL database management  
- **Power BI** – For dynamic dashboards and data storytelling

---

## 🧱 Dataset Features

- Patient admission & discharge details  
- Bed occupancy type (ICU, General, Private)  
- Diagnoses & medical tests  
- Assigned doctors & feedback  
- Billing & insurance information  
- Follow-up dates

---

## 🗂 Steps Followed

### 🔹 Data Cleaning in PostgreSQL
- Handled missing values and inconsistent formats
- Standardized date/time formats
- Used SQL to preprocess and clean data

### 🔹 Querying Insights
- Extracted key metrics using SQL (see below)

### 🔹 Dashboard Creation in Power BI
- Created visualizations for:
  - Admissions trends
  - Revenue analysis
  - Feedback scores
  - Diagnosis patterns
  - Bed occupancy metrics

---

## 📊 SQL Queries

### 🔰 Basic Queries

- Retrieve all patient records  
- List distinct diagnoses  
- Count total patients admitted  
- Filter ICU admissions  
- Display patient-doctor assignments  

### ⚙️ Intermediate Queries

- Total revenue from billing  
- Avg. billing per diagnosis  
- Top 5 doctors by patient count  
- Most common medical tests  
- Average length of stay  
- Patients with follow-up post-discharge  
- Most profitable diagnosis  
- Monthly admission trends  

### 🚀 Advanced Queries

- Insurance coverage % per patient  
- Doctor revenue ranking using `RANK()`  
- Compare coverage by diagnosis  
- Rolling weekly admissions  
- Seasonal and monthly trends  
- Revenue growth over time  
- Identify billing outliers

---

## 📈 Power BI Dashboards

### 🔹 Financial Overview
- Total bill amount: ₹190.43 million  
- Major services revenue:
  - CT Scan: ₹63M  
  - MRI: ₹53M  
  - Blood Tests: ₹58M

### 🔹 Patient Flow & Bed Occupancy
- ICU and private ward metrics  
- Admission & discharge trends

### 🔹 Diagnosis Insights
- Viral infection: 14.3% of total patients  
- Other key conditions: Flu, Malaria, Typhoid, Pneumonia, Fractures

### 🔹 Doctor Feedback Metrics
- Uniform feedback volume (~4.83K per doctor)
- Suggests potential for deeper satisfaction analysis

### 🔹 Trends & Monitoring
- Follow-up patterns  
- Seasonal admission spikes  
- Over 1 year of historical data

## ✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effective integration of **PostgreSQL** and **Power BI** for healthcare analytics. Key takeaways:

- Viral infections were the most common diagnoses  
- Billing often exceeds insurance → potential patient burden  
- Private wards had highest occupancy  
- Doctor feedback scores were consistently high  

> This hands-on experience in structured querying and insightful reporting strengthens my skills in **data analytics**, **healthcare BI**, and **decision intelligence**.
